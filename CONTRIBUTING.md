First of all, **thank you**... For what? Because you are dedicating some time to reading these guidelines and possibly thinking about contributing

<hr>

### I just want to ask a question!

If you have a question, please do not open an issue for this. Instead, use the following resources for it (you will get a faster response):

- [libiiwa's GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Toni-SM/libiiwa/discussions), a place to ask questions and discuss about the project

### I have found a (good) bug. What can I do?

Open an issue on [libiiwa's GitHub issues](https://github.com/Toni-SM/libiiwa/issues) and describe the bug. If possible, please provide some of the following items:

- Minimum code that reproduces the bug...
- or the exact steps to reproduce it
- The error log or a screenshot of it
- A link to the source code of the library that you are using (some problems may be due to the use of older versions. If possible, always use the latest version)
- Any other information that you think may be useful or help to reproduce/describe the problem

#### Notes about contributing

- Try to **communicate your change first** to [discuss](https://github.com/Toni-SM/libiiwa/discussions) the implementation if you want to add a new feature or change an existing one
- Modify only the minimum amount of code required and the files needed to make the change
- Changes that are cosmetic in nature (code formatting, removing whitespace, etc.) or that correct grammatical, spelling or typo errors, and that do not add anything substantial to the functionality of the library will generally not be accepted as a pull request

Thank you once again,

Toni
